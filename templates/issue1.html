											Winter concert — <br/> 
											The Winter Concert was a highlight of the season, with students from various bands and groups coming together to showcase their musical talents. 
											After weeks of practice, they performed a variety of festive pieces that filled the auditorium with holiday spirit. 
											From lively instrumental numbers to beautiful vocal harmonies, the concert spread Christmas cheer through every note. 
											The students’ dedication was evident in each performance, as they played with energy and enthusiasm. 
											The concert not only celebrated the hard work and skill of the performers, but it also brought the school community together to enjoy the magic of the holidays. 
											It was a perfect way to kick off the season, with music that left everyone feeling joyful and connected.
										</p>
										<p id="assembly">Grade 9 assembly + Grade 10 assembly — <br/>
											Throughout the winter months, both the 9th and 10th-grade classes hosted unforgettable assemblies that were engaging and full of energy. 
											The 10th grade’s assembly focused on the important themes of diversity and inclusion, encouraging students to reflect on the value of accepting and celebrating differences. 
											Through thoughtful presentations, playwrights, and performances, the assembly highlighted the importance of creating a welcoming and supportive school community for everyone. 
											Meanwhile, the 9th grade brought the festive season to life with a series of whimsical performances that radiated the Christmas spirit. 
											The assembly featured fun skits, cheerful songs, and even a few surprise acts, all designed to get students in the holiday mood. 
											Both assemblies were not only entertaining but also meaningful, fostering a sense of unity and excitement among the students as they headed into the winter break.

											Dreamfest — <br/>
											Dreamfest was an inspiring event that successfully combined creativity with a powerful cause. 
											Partnering with an NGO focused on the conservation of the Heart of the Arrey Forest, the event featured a variety of engaging performances and stunning artwork. 
											Students from the OIS team worked closely with the NGO to raise both money and awareness for this important environmental initiative. 
											The performances, ranging from music and dance to dramatic skits, captivated the audience, while the artwork on display showcased the immense talent of the students. 
											Every piece, whether it was a painting or a sculpture, helped tell the story of the forest's beauty and the urgent need for its preservation. 
											Not only was Dreamfest an entertaining celebration of art and talent, but it also served as a reminder of the collective responsibility we all share in protecting our planet.
